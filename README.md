# Alpha Blog

#### Description ####
A simple application I created while studying RoR using the Udemy course [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/).

The course has six different projects. But instead of creating a separate project, I merged four of them into one.

The projects included here are:
- alpha_blog
- message_me
- finance-tracker
- photo app

This project is not entirely the same as the projects created on the course. Some of the designs and codes are different.
